    /*
     * CORE PRINCIPLES OF REALISTIC PRESCRIPTION WORKFLOW
     *
     * 1. PATIENT-DOCTOR CONNECTION THROUGH MEDICAL CONTEXT
     *    - Each prescription is tied to a specific clinical encounter (appointment)
     *    - Doctor's credentials and specialty are verified and displayed
     *    - Patient's medical history is accessible during prescription creation
     *
     * 2. MEDICATION SAFETY FIRST APPROACH
     *    - Drug interaction checking against patient's current medications
     *    - Allergy screening before prescription issuance
     *    - Dosage validation based on patient demographics (age, weight, renal function)
     *    - Controlled substance restrictions and monitoring
     *
     * 3. PHARMACY INTEGRATION & E-PRESCRIBING
     *    - Direct e-prescribing to preferred pharmacies
     *    - Pharmacy selection based on location, hours, and insurance acceptance
     *    - Real-time pharmacy inventory checking (where available)
     *    - Prescription transmission with digital signature
     *
     * 4. REFILL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
     *    - Automatic refill scheduling based on medication duration
     *    - Patient-initiated refill requests with justification
     *    - Doctor approval workflow for refills
     *    - Refill history tracking for compliance monitoring
     *
     * 5. DIGITAL SIGNATURE & AUTHENTICATION
     *    - Two-factor authentication for prescription creation
     *    - Digital signature with timestamp and audit trail
     *    - HIPAA-compliant encryption for prescription data
     *    - Audit logs for all prescription activities
     *
     * 6. MEDICAL RECORD INTEGRATION
     *    - Prescription linked to patient's EMR (Electronic Medical Record)
     *    - Automatic updates to medical history when prescriptions are filled
     *    - Lab result integration for dose adjustments
     *    - Clinical decision support based on patient's health data
     *
     * 7. PATIENT EXPERIENCE FEATURES
     *    - Medication education materials with each prescription
     *    - Reminders for medication adherence
     *    - Pharmacy pickup/delivery options
     *    - Ability to share prescriptions with family members/caregivers
     *
     * 8. DOCTOR WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATIONS
     *    - Template-based prescription creation for common conditions
     *    - Voice-to-text medication entry
     *    - Quick access to patient's recent lab results and vitals
     *    - Integration with clinical guidelines and protocols
     *
     * IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
     *
     * Phase 1: Core Prescription System Enhancement
     *   - Enhanced Prescription model with safety fields
     *   - Medication database integration
     *   - Basic drug interaction checking
     *
     * Phase 2: Pharmacy Integration
